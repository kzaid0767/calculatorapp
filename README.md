Calculator app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple 2 number calculator that I built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

# Objective
The maing objective was to test my Javascript skills and to learn a few more things along the way

# Extras
In the process I learn quite a bit about grid in CSS. There is a lot that can be added to improve this app
and I will be comin back as I learn some more about programming and JavaScript specifically.
I also learned some more how to structure the general logic of the program in JS.

# Other Notes
Probably the biggest satisfaction here was being able to code every from scratch from the beginnin all the
to the end of the project.
